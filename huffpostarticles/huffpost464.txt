1 / 5 "Justice League: War"

This is what we hope a live-action Justice League film will be. We don't spend time with individual origin stories, because we don't need to. This is a <strong>group</strong> origin story. We meet these characters by way of them meeting each other. That's the whole basis of the Justice League: the question of whether or not this team-up will work.<br><br>As opposed to the lengthy “we-don’t-need-an-editor” big-budget films, this is resolved nicely in about an hour and 20 minutes as the league battles the incredibly powerful Darkseid. <br> <br>This is as great an introduction to the Justice League as you’re going to get. <br><br>(As of publishing, this is currently on Netflix.)
