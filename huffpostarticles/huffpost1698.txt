Just days after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcomed their new son into the world, the royal baby has made his Lego debut.

Legoland Windsor Resort ― which happens to be located near the residence of the infant’s great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth ― has welcomed the royal family’s Lego counterparts to the park’s Miniland attraction.

The brickture-perfect model shows father William and mother Catherine holding the newborn prince, along with their first two children, Princess Charlotte and Prince George, in front of a Lego recreation of Buckingham Palace.

Of course, no depiction of the royal family would be complete without Lego paparazzi snapping pictures, so they were included as well.
