BASTOY ISLAND, HORTEN, NORWAY - APRIL 11: The former Bastoy Island lighthouse now used by the prison workers as a holiday retreat is seen in on April 11, 2011 in Bastoy Island, Horten, Norway. Bastoy Prison is a minimum security prison located on Bastoy Island, Norway, about 75 kilometers (46 mi) south of Oslo. The facility is located on a 2.6 square kilometer (1 sq mi) island and hosts 115 inmates. Arne Kvernvik Nilsen, governor of the prison, leads a staff of about 70 prison employees. Of this staff, only five employees remain on the island overnight. Once a prison colony for young boys, the facility now is trying to become 'the first eco-human prison in the world.' Inmates are housed in wooden cottages and work the prison farm. During their free time, inmates have access to horseback riding, fishing, tennis, and cross-country skiing.
