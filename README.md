# BBC News Classification

## Week 1

1. Loaded the BBC Dataset

2. Got the .csv file having Article_id, text,labels

3. Split the data into training and testing set

4. Fit the models according to features(tf_idf), labels

5. Implemented Random Forest Classifier & evaluated the accuracy

6. Took a random text and predicted the label

7. Computed the cross-validation accuracy for 4 different models

8. Plotted the Model vs accuracy as a Graph"


## Week 2

1. Took the Scrapped data from @Sana and reformatted it. 

2. Removed the hardcoding of dictionaries such that the model can work on any number of labels/categories. Generated 2 dictionaries. 
   a. Category to integer -> Passes as input to the model
   b. Integer to category -> to map the predicted outcome to it's respective label. 

3. Commented the code. 

4. Tested the model w.r.t different text!
